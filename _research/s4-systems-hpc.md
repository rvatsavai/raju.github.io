      <li>Gaussian Process (GP) Learning: GP based approaches are increasingly being used as a kernel 
        machine learning tool for nonparametric regression and classification. We developed several novel 
        algorithms based on GP learning for classification, change detection and anomaly detection. Despite 
        great advantages of GP in various machine learning tasks, in particular for spatial and temporal data, 
        its wide adaption by the GIS community is limited due to its high computational complexity, 
        O(t<sup>3</sup>), and memory footprint, O(t<sup>2</sup>), where t is the length of time series. 
        In applications like monitoring crop biomass at regional scales, one has to deal with billions of 
        time series, and the solution requires computation of covariance matrix and its inversion for each time 
        series. To overcome these limitations, we chose an exponential covariance function that captures not 
        only the periodic nature of crop growth (phenology) and but also efficient as the resulting covariance 
        is a Toeplitz matrix. Our new solution, GPChange, has reduced complexity to O(t<sup>2</sup>)
        and memory to O(t). In addition, we developed mixed parallel algorithms to take advantage of 
        heterogeneous compute clusters at Oak Ridge leadership computing facility. Our experiments 
        showed significant reduction in computing time from days to seconds compared to the standard 
        Cholesky decomposition-based GP learning on a 128 node SGI Altrix ICE 8200 cluster. This solution 
        was operationalized at ORNL for regional scale continuous biomass monitoring using MODIS satellite 
        based daily NDVI time series. In addition to publishing several papers in leading conferences and journals, 
        the project won the <span style="color:red">ORNL Lab Director's best LDRD project award </span> for the year 2010.

  <li><span style="color:red">Scaling GeoSimulations:</span>
     <ul>
      <li>Geosimulations are widely used in the urban growth modeling, environmental studies, disease spread modeling,
        traffic modeling, and land-use and land-cover changes. Geosimulations are increasingly becoming sophisticated,
        however computational complexity has also increased along with the increase in spatial/temporal extents and finer spatial resolutions.
        To address these computational and I/O challenges, we developed various parallelization strategies for scaling cellular automation 
        based FUTURES model in a distributed computing environment. In particular, we developed intelligent strategies for data
        partitioning, task scheduling, and task synchronization. These strategies have resulted in a highly scalable 
        <span style="color:red">pFUTURES</span> model, which made it possible to study the urban simulations for large spatial and temporal extents at
        a finer spatial resolution than previously reported in the literature. In addition, we developed an adaptive
        mesh refinement strategy, <span style="color:red"> FUTURES-AMR</span>, that further reduced computation 
          and memory requirements for large scale simulations. 
        Typical data parallel approaches in geosimulations use static partitioning strategy along with load-balancing, 
        however in many practical situations some data partitions (tiles) may require that the simulations be run at finer spatial
        resolutions than the other tiles (e.g., to account for important and critical events such as flooding which is localized 
        to fewer tiles). To account
        for such scenarios, we developed a novel provisioning system, <span style="color:red">FUTURES-DPE</span>, 
          that dynamically allocates additional computing 
        resources to the required tiles at run-time. This extension along with our computational steering work, 
        for the first time allowed geosimulation modelers to explore
        what-if scenarios on-the-fly. The <span style="color:red"> FUTURES-AMR</span> work is nominated for best 
        paper award at the top ranking biennial GIScience 2018 conference.

  <li><span style="color:red">In Situ Analytics:</span>
     <ul>
       <li> Hi-resolution simulations on exascale supercomputers are producing petabytes of data. 
         Storing and retrieving such large datasets for analytics is a challenging task. 
         In situ analytics aims at on-the-fly data compression and summarization before the data hits 
         secondary storage, thus minimizing data movement. Summarization and compression at current 
         and future scales requires a framework for developing and benchmarking algorithms. 
         We developed a novel framework by integrating existing, production-ready projects in 
         VTK and demonstrated scaling results of two particular algorithms that serve as exemplars 
         for summarization: a wavelet-based data reduction filter and a generator for creating 
         image-like databases of extracted features (e.g., isocontours in this case). Both these 
         solutions support browser-based, post-hoc, interactive visualization of the summary for 
         decision-making. We also demonstrated weak scaling on a distributed multi-GPU system.
