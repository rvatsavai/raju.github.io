Research on computational steering ...

  <li><span style="color:red">Computational Steering:</span> Geographic modeling using geosimulations 
    is a popular approach to explore outcomes from interacting geographic processes in a region. 
    Geosimulations account for space, time, and complex spatial and spatiotemporal relationships to 
    explore what-if scenarios and their potential impact in a region. However, most simulation systems 
    are designed as black boxes, that take initial inputs from the user and produce final outputs at 
    the completion of simulation. As a result, exploring what-if scenarios are cumbersome and time 
    consuming. In addition, there is no easy way to interact with the simulation system (e.g., visualization) 
    during runtime. To overcome these limitations, we developed a computational steering framework that allows 
    web browser-based visualization and control of geosimulations. This First of a Kind computational steering 
    system enables computationally expensive geosimulations to be modified during the middle of the simulation 
    with new inputs (constraints) without stopping and restarting the simulation, thus allowing for dynamic 
    exploration of what-if scenarios.
